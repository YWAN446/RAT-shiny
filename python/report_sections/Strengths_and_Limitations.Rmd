The primary strength of the SaniPath Tool is that the results focus on risk assessment rather than risk perception and relies on primary data collection – both behavioral surveys and environmental microbiology. The Tool can be adapted to different cultural contexts, employs mobile data collection, and provides automated data analyses and data visualizations. In addition, the unique risk profile visuals provide information for decisions making in a format accessible by a variety of audiences.

However, the tool does have limitations. The Tool was deployed cross-sectionally and so it is not able to capture temporal and seasonal variability in contamination or behaviors. Furthermore, the Tool requires basic laboratory capacity and equipment in order to quantify fecal contamination, which cannot be completed at the sampling site. The information generated is only a snapshot of people’s exposure at the neighborhood level and cannot be generalized to the entire city. This Tool also relies on self-reported information about behavior which may be biased due to social desirability or due to adults either over or underestimating the frequency of specific behaviors of children.

In addition to limitation of the SaniPath Tool, there were challenges in-country. **{Insert sentences about challenges in obtaining data (weather, resources, pathway accessibility)}.** In addition, the environmental samples were only taken from public areas and household level samples and risk of exposure are not measured. Household or individual level hygiene, or other risk-mitigating behaviors (such as household water treatment) are not considered in the risk profiles in this report.
