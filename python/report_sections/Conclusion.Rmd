The deployment of the SaniPath Exposure Assessment Tool in `r params$city_name` highlighted the roles that environment and behavior play in human exposure to fecal contamination. Behavioral surveys and simple microbiological techniques were used to generate risk profiles for study neighborhoods across environmental pathways, including `r params$pathways`. Dominant pathways of exposure varied across neighborhoods and age groups, with dominant pathways for adults including **[majority dominant pathways-adults]**, and dominant pathways for children including **[majority dominant pathways-children]**. Recommendations can be made for potential interventions to reduce exposure to fecal contamination based on behavior and environmental contamination levels in both the public and private domain.
